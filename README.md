# HopHacks2022
Team Technical Difficulties

Firebase Project: ​​https://console.firebase.google.com/project/receiptsandmore-2c960/overview 

This repo contains the entirity of the code for our 2022 HopHacks project. We got the backend of our project working but we couldnt quite get the finishing touches together by the deadlne. We are nonetheless proud of what we achived.

We implemented an AI system to derive the critical information off a receipt.
We designed a bank statement parser to read in a PDF and return data that can be compared to receipts.
We build a backened firebase integrated database managment system that control the upload of new photos and bank statements and compares the two for fraud.
We made a really awesome looking front end user managment system that was connected to our firebase backend system. 

The overall integration of these 4 aspects was not quite ready by the end of HopHacks but the four of us plan to continue working on it in the coming weeks. We all belive in the project and personally want to see it through, both for the personal bennifit of having such an app to use in our daily lives, and out of a commitment to the work that we started. 

Thank you to the HopHacks team for fascilitating this great experiance.
